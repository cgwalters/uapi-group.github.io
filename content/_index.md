# The Linux Userspace API (UAPI) Group

The userspace API ("uapi") group is a cross-distro community for people with an interest in innovating how we build, deploy, run, and safely update modern Linux operating systems.
It serves as a central gathering place for specs, documentation, and ideas.

In scope of the group are secure boot mechanisms, kernel / disk image formats, TPM usage, safe and secure updates, and related topics.
The group also cares about interop of image-based and/or immutable Linux distributions.

The group was founded to discuss and align on common mechanisms, to prevent creating quasi standards by going with implementations first.
Interested engineers are invited to join the discussions, and to represent the directions and interests of their projects and distributions.
